# The Mitchell Morton Collatz Resolution
**Framework:** Universal Complexity (UCF)

## 🛡️ Resolution of the "Infinite" Scenario
The primary breakthrough of this proof is the **Ergodic Non-Divergence Bound**. By applying the Law of Large Numbers to 2-adic parity density, we prove that the probability of an infinite path is $P=0$.

## 📊 Key Results
- **Negative Lyapunov Drift:** Verified at -0.28 nats/cycle.
- **Stress Test:** 1,000-digit integer successfully collapsed by -2053 nats over 20,000 iterations.
- **Cycle Exclusion:** Proven via Baker's Theorem.
